## Overview

Tailscale connections between peers are incredible resiliant. If you are authenticated to Tailscale, it will endeavour to use all mechanisms at its disposal to forge connections it needs between clients.

However, some networks block the Tailscale _control plane_ (ie, the tailscale.com domain) either via DNS blackholing or SNI interception.

Proxyt allows you to host a proxy to the Tailscale control plane which can be used by clients. You can host Proxyt anywhere, register your own domain or even expose it via [Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) giving you a reliable way of accessing the Tailscale control plane to authenticate clients.
